- 👋 Hi, I’m @SymSoilTech
- 👀 I’m interested in Climate Action through Soil Based Carbon Sequestration & Food Security. 
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning more about the soil microbe biome.  Did you know that there are 7+ million species of protozoa, and humanity has NAMES for 21,000? The soil ecosystem is so complex, we don't know what we don't know. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that improves farming to displace chemicals. As of June 2022, I am specifically focused on Midwest Row Crop Farming and working with Blockchain4Ecology to develop carbon credits for soil and biodiversity. 
- Also interested in sensors for soil and compost, NSF's SoilTech and bioreactors.
